🐺 MindWolf – Personal Blog App

A full-stack personal blogging platform where users can create, edit, and manage their own blog posts.
Built as my very first MERN stack project, MindWolf was a challenging yet rewarding experience that introduced me to the real workflow of full-stack development.

🌱 My Experience

At first, I thought creating a blog app would be simple, but I quickly realized there was a lot to learn.

Every step — from React routing, backend APIs, database modeling, and image uploads — taught me something new. It was challenging, but also exciting because I got to build something real.

💡 MindWolf is not just a blog app — it’s a milestone in my web development journey.
